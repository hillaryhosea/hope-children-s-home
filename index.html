            Through working with the community members, local chief and police, we rescue abandoned, orphaned and vulnerable children. <br> What motivates us is that we have seen lives being transformed. <br> We have real life stories of children rescued by us. We have also seen children who we support move from slums to university and some of them are now working. <br>
            
            The children under our care need support and resources to offer them shelter on our rented space, food, education and medication. <br>
